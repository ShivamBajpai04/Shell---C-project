# Proj Shell (`proj`)

`proj` is a simple Unix-like command-line shell written in C. It is designed as an educational project to demonstrate the fundamental concepts behind a command-line shell, such as command parsing, process creation, and execution.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute system commands and programs.
- **Built-in Commands**: Includes built-in commands like `cd`, `help`, and `exit`.
- **Custom Command Parsing**: Supports basic command parsing and argument handling.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error messages for invalid commands and improper usage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any compatible C compiler.
- Make (build automation tool).
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Build the Project**:
    Run the provided script to build and run the shell.
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

This script will compile the code and run the shell executable.

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you will see a prompt (`>`). You can type commands and hit Enter to execute them. The shell will continue running until you type `exit`.

Example:
```sh
> ls -l
> cd /path/to/directory
> help
> exit
```

```

## Built-in Commands

The `proj` shell includes the following built-in commands:

- **`cd [directory]`**: Change the current directory to `[directory]`. If no directory is provided, an error is displayed.
- **`help`**: Display information about the shell and the available built-in commands.
- **`exit`**: Exit the shell.

If a command is not recognized as a built-in command, `proj` will attempt to execute it as an external program.
